	Compiling and Loading the Device Driver Module

        i)   Copy the AP48x device driver routines from the "dev48x"
             directory of the source media to a new directory  under
             /home/AP/AP48X/dev48x.  Device I.D. and device name are
             user selectable see AP48X.h.  Select Message Signaled Interrupt
             (MSI) by locating the "#define AP_USE_MSI_INT" in dev48x.c
             uncomment to enable MSI interrupt.


        ii)  Create device nodes for each carrier in the /dev directory using
             "mknod ap482_0 c 46 0" 	(1st board)
             "mknod ap482_1 c 46 1" 	(2nd board)
             "mknod ap482_2 c 46 2" 	(3rd board)
             "mknod ap482_3 c 46 3" 	(4th board)

             The command line items are as follows:
             ap482_x - Device name x = minor number 0 - 3. 
             c       - Character device driver.
             46      - Major number is defined in the device driver file. The major number
                       must be unique for each type of board/device driver.
                       When two or more different Acromag boards are used in the same system,
                       this number may be changed to avoid device number collisions.
             x       - Minor number 0 to 3.

             To create persistent device nodes for Acromag PCI board products.
             Edit your '/etc/rc.d/rc.local' as follows:
             #Acromag ap482
             if [ ! -r /dev/ap482_0 ]; then
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/ap482_0 c 46 0 #(1st board)
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/ap482_1 c 46 1 #(2nd board)
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/ap482_2 c 46 2 #(3rd board)
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/ap482_3 c 46 3 #(4th board)
             fi

             "mknod ap483_0 c 46 0" 	(1st board)
             "mknod ap483_1 c 46 1" 	(2nd board)
             "mknod ap483_2 c 46 2" 	(3rd board)
             "mknod ap483_3 c 46 3" 	(4th board)

             The command line items are as follows:
             ap483_x - Device name x = minor number 0 - 3. 
             c       - Character device driver.
             46      - Major number is defined in the device driver file. The major number
                       must be unique for each type of board/device driver.
                       When two or more different Acromag boards are used in the same system,
                       this number may be changed to avoid device number collisions.
             x       - Minor number 0 to 3.

             To create persistent device nodes for Acromag PCI board products.
             Edit your '/etc/rc.d/rc.local' as follows:
             #Acromag ap483
             if [ ! -r /dev/ap483_0 ]; then
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/ap483_0 c 46 0 #(1st board)
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/ap483_1 c 46 1 #(2nd board)
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/ap483_2 c 46 2 #(3rd board)
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/ap483_3 c 46 3 #(4th board)
             fi

             "mknod ap484_0 c 46 0" 	(1st board)
             "mknod ap484_1 c 46 1" 	(2nd board)
             "mknod ap484_2 c 46 2" 	(3rd board)
             "mknod ap484_3 c 46 3" 	(4th board)

             The command line items are as follows:
             ap484_x - Device name x = minor number 0 - 3. 
             c       - Character device driver.
             46      - Major number is defined in the device driver file. The major number
                       must be unique for each type of board/device driver.
                       When two or more different Acromag boards are used in the same system,
                       this number may be changed to avoid device number collisions.
             x       - Minor number 0 to 3.

             To create persistent device nodes for Acromag PCI board products.
             Edit your '/etc/rc.d/rc.local' as follows:
             #Acromag ap484
             if [ ! -r /dev/ap484_0 ]; then
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/ap484_0 c 46 0 #(1st board)
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/ap484_1 c 46 1 #(2nd board)
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/ap484_2 c 46 2 #(3rd board)
             /bin/mknod -m 666 /dev/ap484_3 c 46 3 #(4th board)
             fi

             You may also need to change the permissions of this file.
             From a console use 'sudo nautilus --browser'
             
             Owner = root
             Group = root
             Execute = Allow executing as a program
             SELinux Context = initrc_exec_t

             or to change the permissions from a root console
             chown root rc.local
             chown root:root rc.local
             chmod 777 rc.local
 
             You may also need to enable the rc-local service.
             From a console use 'sudo systemctl enable rc-local.service'.
                                      
        iii) Use the makefile to build the project, you may need to install
             elfutils-libelf-devel for your development platform in order
             to use make.

        iv)  As 'root' load the module by using the insmod utility 
             "insmod /home/AP/AP48X/dev48x/ap482.ko".
             "insmod /home/AP/AP48X/dev48x/ap483.ko".
             "insmod /home/AP/AP48X/dev48x/ap484.ko".
 
        v)   Go to the AP48X directory and see the info48X.txt
             file for information about compiling demonstration programs.
