   1. Overview

   This  "information"  file  contains a description of  the library
   programs used for the following models of Acromag Industrial  I/O
   Boards:

         AP236  16-Bit Isolated Analog Output Board



   2. Introduction

   The  software  for  the  AP236 Output  board  is  implemented as
   a library of "C" functions.  This will  make  it     possible  to
   utilize the board by simply  linking  the user's  code  with  the
   provided   library   and   making   function   calls   for   each
   "command"  to be accomplished.  Most of the function  calls  will
   require  a few parameters or the address of a parameter block  to
   be  passed.   The  parameters will  include  the  board  address,
   configuration  information,  data storage addresses,  and  status
   information. These functions accomplish the following tasks:

         - Configuration
         - Read Status
         - Write to DAC's
         - Trigger Output

   Also  included  is  a demonstration program which shows  how  the
   library  routines  are used. It  is a helpful program to use when
   first  installing the board, checking it out, and learning how it
   works.

   In this document, the term "channel" is used to describe  one  of
   8 channels.   Channels are numbered 0 through 7.



   3. List of Files

   The library  software  for  each  Acromag  I/O  board  is  in   a
   correspondingly named  subdirectory on  the supplied  media.  The
   files  which  make  up the  library  for  the  AP236  board  are
   stored in the subdirectory named "AP236".

   There  are two types of program files provided.   Library program
   files are the files which make up the "library".  Support program
   files contain example  programs which show how to use the library
   programs.

        It  is recommended that the user read the  User's Manual for  the
        board  and  thoroughly  familiarize themselves with the hardware.

        For a new user to become familiar with the Acromag Library it may
        be  most  "straight forward"  to proceed in the following manner:

               (a) Build and load the Acromag device driver module.

                 i)   See  the   information  file  in  the device driver
                 directory   "/home/AP/AP236/dev236/info.txt"   for
                 information about building and loading the device driver
                 module.

               (b) Build and execute the Acromag Library Demonstration.

                  i)  Copy the Acromag Library routines from the "AP236"
                  directory of the source media to a new directory  under
                  /home/AP/AP236.


                  ii)  Copy   the  apcommon  support routines  from the
                  "apcommon" directory of the source  media  to  a  new
                  directory  under /home/AP/apcommon.


                  iii) From  a  tty  shell,   make  /home/AP/AP236  the
                  current directory, then use the makefile  to  build the
                  project.

                  iv)  Launch  the  debugger,  "gdb a.out"  use the 'run' 
                  command to start the program or  './a.out' without the
                  debugger. 

                  v)   The  Acromag  Demonstration  program  menu  should
                  appear  on  the  target processor's  console  terminal.

         outputs, using on-board  calibration coefficients, that are
         more accurate.

       Select  9: To start conversion(s) if the Simultaneous Trigger mode
                  was selected.





   6.1 Explanation of the Main Demonstration Menu

   The following is an explanation of each menu selection:

        1. Exit this Program

        This selection causes execution to be  returned to the shell.












				   4




        2. Read Calibration Coefficients.

        The rwcc236() function  is  used to  perform  the read  the
        calibration coefficients for the board.   A  pointer to the
        Configuration Block will be passed to this routine.     The
        routine  will  use  a  pointer  together  with  offsets  to
        reference the  registers on  the Board  and  will  transfer
        information from the Board to the Configuration Block.

        3. Read Status

	This menu selection will call the rsts236() function and pass
	a pointer which points to the Configuration Block  structure.
	The  current status information is read from the  board  and
	written into this structure by the rsts236()  function.  The
	status information is then displayed by the example program.

        4. Examine/Change Current Channel

	This menu selection will  allow the user  to select  one of
	eight DAC output channels available for use on the module.

        5. Set Up Configuration Block Parameters

	This  selection will cause the Configuration Block Parameter
	Menu to be displayed.  Through that menu it will be possible
	to  enter values into the various structure members  of  the
	Configuration Block structure.   See section 6.2 for details
	on the Configuration Block Parameter Menu which follows.

        6. Configure Channel

	This  menu selection will call the  cnfg236()  function  and
	pass  a  pointer  which points to  the  Configuration  Block
	structure.    Information  in  the  Configuration Block will
	be written to the channel.

        7. Write Ideal Data to Output

        This command will calculate an ideal(uncorrected) data count
        based on your desired  voltage and write it  to  the current
        DAC channel.

        8. Write Corrected Data to Output

        This command will calculate a corrected data count using the
        gain and offset coefficients and write it to the current DAC
        channel. Use this selection to obtain greatest accuracy.

        9. Simultaneous Trigger

        This  command will  write a 1 to the  "Simultaneous Trigger"
        register.  This must be done in order for the board to start
        generating outputs if the Simultaneous Trigger Mode has been
        selected.





				   5




        10. Display Ideal/Corrected Data, Gain/Offset Coefficients

        Displays the data and coefficients for each  channel on  the
        board, where ID  = ideal(uncorrected)  data, CD  = corrected
        data, GD  = gain  data(coefficient), and  OD  = offset  data
        (coefficient).

        11. Clear Data Buffers

        Clears out all of the ideal (uncorrected) and corrected data
        buffers.

        12. Alter Offset/Gain Coefficients

        This selection allows  the user to  alter the  gain, and  offset
        coefficients read from the board.   The  user  may determine his
        own  gain and offset coefficients by measuring the zero and full
        scale  output voltages  with a DVM,  typing the  values into the
        program,  and load  them into  the gain and offset data buffers.



   6.2  Explanation of the Configuration Parameter Menu

   This menu  is  displayed  when  the  user  selects  the  "Set  Up
   Configuration  Block  Parameters"  menu  item  from  the  Library
   Demonstration Menu.   Through the Configuration Parameter Menu it
   will  be  possible  for  the  user  to  enter  values  into  the
   configuration structure.    The configuration structure is used by
   the cnfg236()function.      Following is the "Set Up Configuration
